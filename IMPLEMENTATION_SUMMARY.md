# Page Master & Content Management System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Models
Created two new MongoDB models:

**`models/Page.js`**
- Stores page information (name, path, template, status, SEO data)

- Auto-generates path from slug
- Tracks creation and updates

**`models/Content.js`**
- Stores content blocks linked to pages
- Supports rich text content
- Includes thumbnail, category, and custom fields
- Ordered display support

### 2. API Routes
Created comprehensive REST API endpoints:

**`routes/api/pageApi.js`**
- `GET /api/pages` - List all pages (with search, filter, pagination)
- `GET /api/pages/:id` - Get single page
- `POST /api/pages` - Create new page
- `PUT /api/pages/:id` - Update page
- `DELETE /api/pages/:id` - Delete page and its content

- `GET /api/content/:id` - Get single content
- `POST /api/content` - Create new content
- `PUT /api/content/:id` - Update content
- `DELETE /api/content/:id` - Delete content

### 3. Page Routes

**`routes/page-master.js`**
- `/page-master/web-page-master` - List all pages
- `/page-master/add-page` - Add new page form
- `/page-master/edit-page/:id` - Edit page form

**`routes/cms.js`**
- `/cms/content-management` - List all content
- `/cms/add-content-management` - Add content form (with page dropdown)
- `/cms/edit-content-management/:id` - Edit content form

**`routes/routes.js`**
- Added dynamic route handler `/:slug` - Renders any created page

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema
- **Pages Collection**: Stores page metadata
- **Contents Collection**: Stores content blocks with page references

### Route Flow
1. User creates page → Saved to database
2. Dynamic route handler catches `/:slug` requests
3. Looks up page by slug in database
4. Fetches all active content for that page
5. Renders using `dynamicPage.ejs` template

### AJAX Implementation
- All create/update/delete operations use AJAX
- No page reloads required
- Real-time feedback to users
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Security
- All routes protected with `isAuthenticated` middleware
- Input validation on API endpoints
- Unique constraints on page names and paths
- User tracking (createdBy, updatedBy)
