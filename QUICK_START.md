# 🚀 Quick Start - Secure Site Settings

## ✅ What's Done

1. ✅ Pinterest replaced with Telegram
2. ✅ Logo upload feature added
3. ✅ Public APIs created
4. ✅ **SMTP credentials protected** (your main concern)
5. ✅ All data saves to MongoDB

## 🔒 Security Status

**Your SMTP credentials (username/password) are now 100% secure:**
- ❌ NOT visible in public APIs
- ❌ NOT accessible to unauthenticated users
- ✅ Only visible to authenticated admins
- ✅ Protected at database schema level

---

## 🎯 Quick Test

### 1. Install & Start
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### 2. Test Public API (Should NOT show SMTP)
Open browser: `http://localhost:8080/test-social-api.html`

**Expected:** You'll see logo, site name, social links
**Expected:** NO SMTP credentials visible ✅

### 3. Test Admin Access (Should show SMTP)
1. Login to admin panel
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8080/settings/site-settings`
3. You should see SMTP fields (because you're authenticated)

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Public (No Auth Required)
```
GET /settings/api/social-links      → Social media links only
GET /settings/api/site-settings     → Logo, name, social links (NO SMTP)
```

### Protected (Auth Required)
```
POST /settings/upload-logo          → Upload site logo
POST /settings/site-settings        → Update all settings
POST /settings/test-smtp            → Test SMTP connection
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Security

### Test 1: Public API
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/settings/api/site-settings
```
**Should NOT contain:** `smtp` field ✅

### Test 2: Search for SMTP
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/settings/api/site-settings | grep smtp
```
**Should return:** Nothing (no matches) ✅
