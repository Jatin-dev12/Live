# Dashboard Permission Fix

## ‚úÖ Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Dashboard was showing by default for all users, even if the "Dashboard" permission was not checked during user creation.

**Solution**: Added permission check to the Dashboard menu item in the sidebar.

## Changes Made

### File: `views/partials/sidebar.ejs`

#### Before (Dashboard always visible):
```html
<!-- Dashboard - Always visible for all authenticated users -->
<li class="active-pagee">
    <a href="/index">
        <iconify-icon icon="solar:home-smile-angle-outline" class="menu-icon"></iconify-icon>
        <span>Dashboard</span>
    </a>
</li>
```

#### After (Dashboard only visible with permission):
```html
<!-- Dashboard - Only visible if permission is granted -->
<% if (typeof userRole !== 'undefined' && (userRole === 'super-admin' || (typeof userPermissions !== 'undefined' && userPermissions.includes('dashboard')))) { %>
<li class="active-pagee">
    <a href="/index">
        <iconify-icon icon="solar:home-smile-angle-outline" class="menu-icon"></iconify-icon>
        <span>Dashboard</span>
    </a>
</li>
<% } %>
```

## How It Works Now

### Super Admin
- ‚úÖ **Always sees Dashboard** (regardless of permissions)

### Other Users (Admin, Manager, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Sees Dashboard** only if "Dashboard" checkbox is checked during user creation/edit
- ‚ùå **Does NOT see Dashboard** if checkbox is unchecked

## Permission Check Logic

```javascript
userRole === 'super-admin' || userPermissions.includes('dashboard')
```

- **Super Admin**: Bypasses permission check
- **Other Roles**: Must have 'dashboard' in their customPermissions array

## Testing

### Test 1: Create User WITHOUT Dashboard Permission
1. Go to Users Management
2. Click "Add New User"
3. Fill in user details
4. **DO NOT check "Dashboard" checkbox**
5. Save user
6. Login as that user
7. **Expected**: Dashboard menu item is **NOT visible** ‚úÖ

### Test 2: Create User WITH Dashboard Permission
1. Go to Users Management
2. Click "Add New User"
3. Fill in user details
4. **CHECK "Dashboard" checkbox**
5. Save user
6. Login as that user
7. **Expected**: Dashboard menu item **IS visible** ‚úÖ

### Test 3: Edit Existing User - Remove Dashboard
1. Edit a user who has Dashboard access
2. **UNCHECK "Dashboard" checkbox**
3. Save changes
4. Login as that user
5. **Expected**: Dashboard menu item is **NOT visible** ‚úÖ

### Test 4: Super Admin
1. Login as Super Admin
2. **Expected**: Dashboard always visible (regardless of permissions) ‚úÖ

## Sidebar Permissions Summary

| Menu Item | Permission Required | Super Admin |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Dashboard | `dashboard` | Always visible |
| Users Management | Super Admin only | Always visible |
| Website Page Master | `cms` | Always visible |
| Content Management | `content` | Always visible |
| Menu Management | `menu` | Always visible |
| Media | `media` | Always visible |
| SEO Management | `seo` | Always visible |
| Ads Management | `ads` | Always visible |
| Leads Management | `leads` | Always visible |

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Granular Control**: Admins can control who sees the Dashboard  
‚úÖ **Consistent Behavior**: Dashboard follows same permission pattern as other menu items  
‚úÖ **Security**: Users only see what they're authorized to access  
‚úÖ **Flexibility**: Can create users with specific access needs  

## Notes

- **Super Admin** always has access to all menu items
- **Other roles** only see menu items for which they have permissions
- Permissions are set via checkboxes during user creation/edit
- Permissions are stored in the `customPermissions` array in the User model

---

**The Dashboard permission is now working correctly!** Users will only see the Dashboard if explicitly granted permission. üéâ
